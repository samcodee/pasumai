This is a project is made by [@samcodee](https://github.com/samcodee) as a proof of concept for my submission to the IIT Bombay SOF Techfest 2024-25

This code is not production ready and hence cannot be distributed. Hence, additional steps are required to get this running.

# Running the project locally

## Requirements:
- A laptop/desktop with NodeJS, Python, Android Studio
- A RaspberryPI* with PiCamera
- A smartphone* (The app is meant for Android but may work in iOS.)

\* - Optional but may not provide the full experience

## 0. Clone the project locally

## 1. Creating an Expo Dev Client
1. Run `eas build -p android --profile development`. You may be asked to login with your Expo account. Create an account if you don't have one already.
2. You will get a development client. Install the .APK in your mobile phone.

## 2. Running the React Native App
1. Run `yarn start`. You must have the Android Studio Tools installed. 
2. Press `a` to open the app in the emulator or
scan the QRCode or enter the URL in the app
3. The app should be open. 

Note: You must create a Mapbox account and add the API key to `token.key` and in `/components/MapScreen.tsx`

## 3. Running the backend 
Go to `/backend`

1. Run `pip install torch uuid random transformers Pillow requests flask`
2. Run `mkdir uploads`
3. If you are **not** using a RaspberryPi and running the Dustbin Software on the same device as the backend, run `python app-qr.py`.
4. If you are using a RaspberryPi or using the Dustbin Software on a different device, you will have to start the Dustbin Software in that device and then change the IP to that device's IP in line `39` in `app-qr.py`, in the `/verify-otp` route handler.

## 4. Running the Dustbin Software
### If you do **not** have a RaspberryPi,
1. Run `pip install qrcode` (You must have the packages in Step 3. Running the backend too installed.)
2. Run `python piapp_desktop.py`. If you have a different device for the backend server, you will have to change the IP of the backend in the `get_and_show_qr_code()` function.
3. A window with QRCode will open.

### If you do have a RaspberryPi,
1. Install the packages `qrcode`, `Pillow`, `tkinter`, RaspberryPi's GPIO and PiCamera packages, `flask`, `requests`, etc.
2. If you want the dustbin to open and close automatically, refer section *"Automatic control of Dustbin Lid"*
3. Connect the PiCamera, enable it in `raspi-config` if you have to.
4. Transfer the piapp.py file. Make sure to add the backend's IP in `Line 79: display_timer()` and `Line 112: get_and_show_qr_code()`
5. Run `python piapp.py`
6. A fullscreen window with the QRCode will open. When the user scans this, the dustbin opens (using the servo).

The clicked image by the phone and the video in the PiCamera in the dustbin is sent to the backend. 

Currently, validation is not done at the dustbin using the camera. However, a basic version of that, using a custom trained model is implemented:

## Automatic control of Dustbin Lid
Although not the best implementation, it is possible to automatically open and close the dustbin lid.

Requirements: (A lot of these are unnecessary, but this is what I used.)
- A servo
- PCA9685
- Jumper wires
- Arduino UNO

Add the code in `arduino/withanalog.ino` to the Arduino.

Connect the wiring as shown:

Everything else should work.
